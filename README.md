# Mathematical Capabilities of Language Models

Welcome to the repository for our Masterâ€™s thesis project, which explores **mathematical capabilities of language models**. We examine current research and development on how which techniques are utilized by researchers to optimize mathematical capabilities and reasoning in (small/large) language models .

## Overview

- **Goal**: 

- **Initial Approach**:


  ---

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize the environment**
    ```bash
    source init.sh
    ```
* Note: The `init.sh` script already takes care of setting up and activating the `.venv` environment. The following steps are provided as a fallback.
* This setup is specifically designed for the use of CUDA GPUs. Adaptions might be neccessary depending on available compute resources.

2. **Set up Weights & Biases**
* Run `wandb login` to initialize your login and add your API key when prompted.

3. **Further Instructions will follow as project develops**
